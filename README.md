# QA Automation Practice Project

This repository contains automated test scripts written in C# using the NUnit framework and Selenium WebDriver. 
The tests are designed to practice and improve my skills in test automation, focusing on Page Object Model and cross-browser compatibility.

Please note: You might have to download and place EdgeDriver somewhere local first.

## Technologies Used

- **C#** – Programming language
- **Selenium WebDriver** – Browser automation tool
- **NUnit** – Test framework for organising and running tests
- **Page Object Model (POM)** – Design pattern for maintainable, scalable, and reusable test code
- **Cross-browser testing** – Tests run on multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge)

## Project Overview

This project serves as a personal practice suite to enhance my automation skills, including:

- Writing clean, maintainable tests using POM
- Utilising FluentAssertions for clear, concise code
- Implementing tests for different browsers
- Using NUnit for test organisation and assertions
- Practicing Selenium WebDriver commands for interacting with web elements

## Notes

- This project is a work in progress, focused on learning and exploring different techniques, rather than getting things perfect
- Feel free to reach out if you have any comments or suggestions, constructive criticism always welcome
